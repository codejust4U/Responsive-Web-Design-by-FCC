        <p>
          Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
          efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
          approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and
          dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal
          language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas
          on most platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely
          available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the
          Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely
          distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers
          to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and
          additional documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data
          types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C).
          Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable
          applications.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Python interpreter is usually installed as
            /usr/local/bin/python3.12 on those machines where it is available;
            putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it
            possible to start it by typing the command:
          </li>
          <li>
            On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the
            Microsoft Store, the python3.12 command will be available. If you
            have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the py command. See
            Excursus: Setting environment variables for other ways to launch
            Python

        <header>Data types</header>
        <p>
          Built-in Data Types In programming, data type is an important concept.
          Variables can store data of different types, and different types can
          do different things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these
          categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text Type: str</li>
          <li>Numeric Types: int, float, complex</li>
          <li>Sequence Types: list, tuple, range</li>
          <li>Mapping Type: dict</li>
          <li>Set Types: set, frozenset</li>
          <li>Boolean Type: bool</li>
          <li>Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview</li>
          <li>None Type: NoneType</li>
        </ul>
        <code>
          x = 5
          <br />
          print(type(x))

        <header>Conditional Statements</header>
        <p>Python Conditions and If statements</p>
        <p>
          These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if
          statements" and loops. An "if statement" is written by using the if
          keyword.
        </p>
        <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Equals: a == b</li>
          <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
          <li>Less than: a < b</li>
          <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
          <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
          <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
        </ul>
        <code>
          a = 33 <br />

          b = 200 <br />

          if b > a: <br />
          print("b is greater than a") <br />

          The while Loop With the while loop we can execute a set of statements
          as long as a condition is true.

          Python For Loops A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
          (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
          This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and
          works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated
          programming languages.

        <p>
          A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You
          can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can
          return data as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating a Function In Python a function is defined using the def
          keyword:
        </p>
        <p>
          Calling a Function To call a function, use the function name followed
          by parenthesis:
        </p>
        <p>
          Arguments Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
          Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the
          parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate
          them with a comma
        </p>
